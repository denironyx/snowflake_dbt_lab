# snowflake_dbt_lab
In this lab, I learnt how to use dbt and Snowflake to build data transformation pipelines for analytics. 

## Overview
Modern businesses need modern data strategies, built on platforms that support agility, growth and operational efficiency.

Snowflake is the Data Cloud, a future-proof solution that simplifies data pipelines, so you can focus on data and analytics instead of infrastructure management.

dbt is a transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. Now anyone who knows SQL can build production-grade data pipelines. It transforms data in the warehouse, leveraging cloud data platforms like Snowflake.

In this Quickstart, you will follow a step-by-step guide to using dbt with Snowflake, and see some of the benefits this tandem brings. https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/
